When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you need to collaborate with others or work from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may get merge conflicts that need to be resolved manually. Also, you may
    wish to keep them out of sync for some reason.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to create a copy of another GitHub repository on GitHub.
    This would be used when I want to create my own copy of some repository.
    Clones are basic Git behavior to get a local copy of some repository.
    Use clones to get a local copy to work with.
    Branches are used locally to track multiple versions of the repository.
    A branch can be used to add a new feature without affecting the current
    working copy that others might be relying on.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    One benefit is that you can work offline and still keep track of the main
    branch of the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use Google Drive or Dropbox, but if it were code, I see no reason to
    not use Git / GitHub. Simultaneous collaboration can be easier with Drive,
    and Dropbox is not exactly a bad solution, but GitHub is better and easier
    to track for dependent changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If the changes are substantially different or you want to make a series of
    small changes that may temporarily break functionality.
