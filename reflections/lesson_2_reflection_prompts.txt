What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates some metadata about the repository. This allows you to use the
    various funtionality that Git provides.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a working copy of files to be commited in the next
    commit. They are in the working directory, but not yet a part of the
    committed repository. This allows us to only commit the things we really
    want commited in the next commit rather than whatever happens to be in the
    working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    Only stage the files for one logical change at a time. The others can wait.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Branches are really helpful if you want to keep track of multiple changes
    at the same time while keeping them hermetic. This makes it easier to split
    up work and to keep the main flow working while a broader initiative is in
    the works.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They help visually represent the current status of each branch and which
    commits have been added to a branch. This could be useful when we want to
    combine two commits in the future.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    The result is a new commit containing all of the changes in the branches.
    This allows a main branch to incorporate the work from another branch so
    that separate features can be worked on independently.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    It's very nice when it works because it can take a lot of the manual labor
    out of doing the merge step. When there is ambiguity, the behavior allows
    you to intervene when necessary. Sometimes, it may silently do the merge
    incorrectly and can have unexpected results.
