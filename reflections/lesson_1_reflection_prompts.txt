How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes typos much easier to find. Narrows down the scope of code that
    must be searched in order to find a problem. Also helps in a review process
    where the reviewer is checking for issues with new code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Frequently we make a change that we later decide was not how we wanted the
    file to appear. Having the ability to get the old content is essential if
    you don't want to do that work over again. It may also explain why the file
    is the way it is today, particularly if the file is old and had several
    authors along the way.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: the commit allows you to keep the content functional. Arbitrary saves
    can be broken and it is very hard to find where a particular change came in.
    Cons: you have to remember to do it manually. If you forget a few commits,
    that can be very costly. Also, naming can get tricky. As you go along, it is
    tempting to use low-quality descriptions for each commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Many files logically go together and if you break them apart in commits, the
    functionality of those files can break easily. As such it is much better to
    allow the files to be commited together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The git log command tells you all of the descriptions for each of the
    commits to the repository. It also gives you the ID for the commit which
    can then be used to get a diff between two commits showing what changed
    between those two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
